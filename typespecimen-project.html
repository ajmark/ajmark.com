        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this assignment was to experiment with different aspects of typographic hierarchy, which include weight, linespacing, position, size and color, in order to effectively communicate the unique characteristics of a specific typeface. In order to successfully portray the typeface, we were required to do a significant amount of research about its history and its uses. Our goal was to clearly present our information and discover how typographical signals serve as visual cues for hierarchy and association.

        <h2>Project Process</h2>
        <p> In beginning to create my poster, I wanted to base my project off of the fact that Avenir is the French word for “Future”. My original idea was to focus more on a theme that included the French flag and the poster really focused on highlighting some of the unique physical characteristics of the Avenir typeface. I took inspiration from this sample Avenir type specimen: http://www.behance.net/gallery/Avenir-Type-Specimen/2035743. I really liked the layering of the graphics between the letters and the simplicity of the overall design from this sample. In my poster, there was lots of information I wanted to include. After completion, I realized the color scheme was a little off, and the right side of the poster seemed too busy. The “French” design was too literal and the character set was hard to read. In my second iteration, I decided to go a completely different direction with my poster. I took inspiration from this sample Avenir type specimen: http://www.behance.net/gallery/Avenir-Type-Specimen/3272223. I really like this sample’s full  color scheme and how it used a combination of background and foreground  to display some of the Avenir characters. The issue with my second iteration is that the two blue’s I picked were too similar on print and did not show up. The poster still felt busy and the combination of lines, edges and circles did not help its overall clarity. I attempted to use sharp corners and edges to demonstrate a more futuristic theme, but these lines were too sharp. In my final iteration, I used the solid blocks of colors and lines with softer corners in attempt to maintain a futuristic feel. I took the layered styling from the first iteration to help accentuate the name of the typeface. My goal was for people to read the quote first, then move towards the name of the typeface. I tried to pick a better color scheme to attempt to portray the French flag colors, and not seem too “American” red, white and blue.
