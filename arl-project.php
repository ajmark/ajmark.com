      <h1> Website Redesign | <span> The Animal Rescue League of Pittsburgh</span></h1>

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
          <p>This was a school project with a mock client. The purpose of the project was to use what I have learned about typography and grid systems to redesign a website for an organization. I was assigned the <a href="http://www.animalrescue.org/" target="_blank">Animal Rescue League of Pittsburgh</a>. I had to make special considerations for the content and the design objectives that the clients wanted to include in the website. A large part of this project involved understanding the interactive parts of web design and how different layouts would offer the best experience for the users.
          </p>
          <br>
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <p>One of the main goals of the Animal Rescue League client was to increase the number of views on the adoption page to help improve adoption numbers from the center. Some of the pain points of the current website are that there is no clear call to action, the information is unorganized and irrelevant to their listed categories, and that there are too many navigation options on the homepage for the user to easily make a decision from. In my first iteration of the homepage, I made the adoption page the focus of the website. I attempted to create a clear call to action to visit the adoption page to address the design objectives of the client.
