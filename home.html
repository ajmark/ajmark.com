          Just call me <span>Alex</span>.
        </h1>
        <h2 class='text-body'>I am a Carnegie Mellon student, studying Information Systems and Human Computer Interaction. I aspire to work in the UX field through the use of my skills as a software developer and my affinity for design and interfaces. Explore my website and let me introduce myself. </h2>

					<img id='goldengate' src='images/goldengate.png' width='300px'>
        	<h2 class='text-body'>I'm a Bay Area native. Growing up on the San Francisco Peninsula, I have had a lot of exposure to the Silicoln Valley and all of the opportunities it has to offer. However, moving to Pittsburgh for school was the best decision I could have ever made. This city has given me a new perspective on how I view the world and how I can apply myself. It has helped me appreciate everything I have in life and all of my experiences.</h2>

				<div class='text-wrap inside-text'>
          <h2 class='text-body'><span>Ukulele &amp; Guitar</span>: Growing up, I was a hip-hop junkie and I never would have expected to fall in love with the Ukulele. I started playing my Freshman year in college and I couldn't stop. Before you know it, I was playing songs by famous Ukulele artists such as Jake Shimabukuro and Troy Fernandez. <br>One thing led to another and in my Sophomore year of college, I bought myself an Alvarez acoustic guitar and I was once again hooked. The challenge of teaching yourself a skill from scratch is something I find exciting and addicting. I've mainly been using my guitar to progress my soloing techniques but I love trying to pick up a song by Tommy Emmanuel every now and then.</h2>
				  <h2 class='text-body'><span>Sports</span>: Mainly basketball but I love all sports, both watching and playing. My teams/heroes include The Warriors, Giants, 49ers, Novak Djokovic, </h2>
				  <h2 class='text-body'><span>Sneakers</span>: I'm a snearkerhead. My friends in highschool got me into the culture and even though I'm not quite on their level, I can still hold my own. I still catch myself browsing sites like SoleCollector every now and then...</h2>

          <h2><span>March 2013</span>: I broke my ankle. Probably one of the most painful and difficult experiences of my life, I don't reccomend it. I fractured the fibula and displaced the tibia by a couple of millimeters. It required 9 screws and a plate to fix. I'm still feeling the effects from the surgery but the whole experience has taught me a lot about myself and has made me thankful for my health. I'm glad I now have a really cool scar and pictures to share.</h2>
