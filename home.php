          <h2><span>Summer 2013</span>: I spent this past summer working for BNY Mellon as a software development intern. I worked on the web application team where we spent the summer preparing to upgrade the application to the latest version of the software. I created components such as a datagrids with filtering, sorting and other features for the new portal using the Dojo framework. I also gained lots of exposure to server-side Java (JSP) and noSQL databases through development with MongoDB. Check me out in the video below!</h2>

        	<h2>I grew up on the San Francisco Peninsula but I currently live in Pittsburgh, PA as I attend school. My major is in Information Systems and I am taking a minor in Human Computer Interaction, which I am working on turning into a second major. Through all of my work experience, I have discovered that the proper display of information and development of user-friendly software is essential to a company's success. This is my niche and I want to be able to utilze my skills as a programmer (with an eye for design) to help solve the information crisis.</h2>

          <h2><span>Ukulele &amp; Guitar</span>: The challenge of teaching yourself a skill from scratch is something I find exciting and addicting, which I think is why I started getting into these instruments. Growing up, I was a hip-hop junkie and I never would have expected to fall in love with the Ukulele. I started playing my Freshman year in college and I couldn't stop. Before you know it, I was playing songs by famous Ukulele artists such as <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSkP3uym5k' target='_blank'>Jake Shimabukuro</a> and Troy Fernandez. The following year I bought myself an Alvarez acoustic guitar and I was once again hooked. I've mainly been using my guitar to progress my soloing techniques but I love trying to pick up a song by <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhR04kmcSXU' target='_blank'>Tommy Emmanuel</a> every now and then.</h2>
				  <h2><span>Sports</span>: Mainly basketball but I love all sports, both watching and playing. My teams/heroes include The Warriors, Giants, 49ers, Novak Djokovic, and Derrick Rose. </h2>
				  <h2><span>Sneakers</span>: I'm a snearkerhead. My friends in highschool got me into the culture and even though I'm not quite on their level, I can still hold my own. I still catch myself browsing sites like <a href='http://solecollector.com/' target='_blank'>SoleCollector</a> every now and then...</h2>
