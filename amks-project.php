        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p> This was a semester long project assigned in my Web Application Design and Development class. Our task was to use Ruby on Rails to create a dynamic web application for a mock karate tournament system. Through this project and this class, I learned how to:<br>1. Model data and translate data models into working databases<br>2. Be familiar with the Model-View-Controller pattern in software architecture<br>3. Understand the importance of test driven development<br>4. Use source code control to manage project development through Git<br>5. Apply principles of user-centered design to the development of software<br>6. Apply all of these skills to build a web-based application

        <h2>Project Process</h2>
        <p> The web app was created in five different phases, each having its own focus on aspects of web application development.<br>In <span>phase 1</span> of the project, we focused on creating the data model of the application through an entity-relationship diagram, database design in third normal form, a data dictionary, and use cases.<br><span>Phase 2</span> of the project introduced us to unit testing and the creation of tables for the database.<br><span>Phase 3</span> focused primarily on the views of the application, where we implemented user-centered design techniques to create an easy-to-use interface. We also established CRUD functionality in our application during this phase which allowed the application began to have functional components through the use of controllers.<br>In the following two phases, <span>phase 5</span> &amp; <span>phase 6</span>, we implemented more advanced processes to the application such as authentication, authorization and dashboards. We also revisited aspects of previous phases by adding additional unit tests.
