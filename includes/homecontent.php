          <h2><span>Summer 2013</span>: I spent this past summer working for <a href ='http://www.bnymellon.com'>BNY Mellon</a> as a web application development intern. I worked on a team where we spent the summer preparing to upgrade the application to the next version of the software. I created components such as a datagrids with filtering, sorting in and other features in JavaScript for the new portal using the Dojo framework. I also gained exposure to server side Java and noSQL databases through development with MongoDB. Check me out in the video below!</h2>

					<h2><span>Summer 2010</span>: I completed my first internship at <a href='http://www.cibsr.stanford.edu'>Stanford's Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research</a> (CIBSR) as a technical intern. This was where I was introduced to how software development and usable interfaces really makes an impact on efficiency in the workplace. I worked on a software called Brain Image Java (BIJ) with my mentor, and we spent the summer improving its UI components. All of the programming was done in Java. Simple changes such as the location of a scrollbar or the default settings for the MRI display helped make the software less painful to use for the lab researchers.</h2>

					<img id='goldengate' src='images/goldengate.png' width='200px'>
        	<h2>I grew up on the San Francisco Peninsula but I currently live in Pittsburgh, PA as I attend school. My major is in Information Systems and I am taking a minor in Human Computer Interaction, which I am working on turning into a dual major. Through my experiences as an intern, I have discovered that the efficient display of information and the development of user-friendly software is essential to a successful company, no matter what industry it is in. This is my niche and I want to be able to utilze my skills as a programmer (with an eye for design) to help build better interfaces.</h2>

          <h2><span>Ukulele &amp; Guitar</span>: The challenge of teaching yourself a skill from scratch is something I find exciting and addicting, which is why I started getting into these instruments. I bought a Kala tenor ukulele my freshman year in college and the following year I bought myself an Alvarez acoustic guitar and I was once again hooked. Check out <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhR04kmcSXU' target='_blank'>Tommy Emmanuel</a>, <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSkP3uym5k' target='_blank'>Jake Shimabukuro</a> and <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naHHHwoMDaU'>Troy Fernandez</a>. They are some of my favorite soloists.</h2>
				  <h2><span>Athletics</span>: I was a <a href='http://usfencing.org' target='_blank'>nationally competitive epe&eacute; fencer</a> for about four years. Fencing is a sport unlike any other, sometimes referred to as "physical chess". It has helped me learn to analyze a situation, and develop a strategy for solving a problem. Fencing also allowed me to explore the United States as I traveled on my own to tournaments nationwide: Des Moine, Iowa - Kansas City, Missouri - Miami, Florida and Grapevine, Texas to list a few. It gave me exposure to several regions of the country that I otherwise would have never experienced. Basketball is my favorite but I love all sports, both watching and playing. My teams/heroes include The Warriors, Giants, 49ers, Novak Djokovic, and Derrick Rose. </h2>
				  <h2><span>Sneakers</span>: I'm a snearkerhead. My friends in highschool got me into the culture and even though I'm not quite on their level, I can still hold my own. I still catch myself browsing sites like <a href='http://solecollector.com/' target='_blank'>SoleCollector</a> every now and then.</h2>
